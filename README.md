# Wavey

Wavey is a simply designed login screen for Surfing fanatics using Firebase for authentication and Realm Database for persisting preferences.

Using the Firebase Authentication SDK, users can create an account and login using an email and password. The Realm Database was used for persisting a users name and favourite surfing location.

Whilst this project was relatively simple and didnâ€™t do much more than log you in and help you express your inner surfer, it was key in helping me understand how to integrate third-party libraries for login authentication and persisting data offline.
